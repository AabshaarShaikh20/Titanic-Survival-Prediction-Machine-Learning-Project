## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning techniques. By analyzing passenger data such as age, gender, class, and fare, we build models to classify whether a passenger survived or not.


## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the famous Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers on the Titanic, including whether they survived or not. The data is available in the `data/` directory.


## Getting Started
1. Download the code from the repository
2. Download the dataset from the `data/` directory
3. Install the required python packages if previously not insatlled
4. Finally run on Jupyter Notebook and enjoy!!
